                <p>My name is Osman Shaon. Currently I am doing my Associate degree in Computer Science major at the
                    Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC). I have completed my HSE (High School Equivalency)
                    diploma at the Queen public library.</p>
                <p>I want to build my career in Software Application Development because I love coding. Also, I like the
                    nature of Software Application Development. It is challenging, exciting, and growth-oriented. In
                    addition, I love to do Meditation and Yoga almost every day. I believe “patient is the key to
                    success” that my hard work and perseverance will help me in achieving my career goal with greater
                    professional success. I try to keep learning by myself every day in achieving my career goal at BMCC
                    and in my real life.</p>
